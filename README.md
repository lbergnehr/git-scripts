# git-scripts

## Prerequisites
Right now I use some git aliases that you might not have, namely:

0. `git l` for `git log` with some switches.
0. `git b` for `git branch`.

Moreover the remote name is hard coded to *origin*.

## `git-incoming`
Taken from the Mercurial equivalent this logs what the remote has but your local branches does not.

## `git-outgoing`
Same as `git-incoming` but shows the changes that your local branches have but the remote ones do not.
